#Development

The goal of my application is to allow someone to add baked goods to their cart. 
It is an extension of the ReactStudio because as hard as I tried.... my own one was
absolutely not working. 

The main componenents are BakeryItems, props are related to the individual items
state is used as a way to monitor the condition of various constants and components
which can be updated using useState{}. In terms of usability principles, it is pure
dumpster-fire... the layout is... not ideal, and there is no real hierarchy or navigation. 


SIDE NOTE:

I spent so much time working on a redesign for the Books on the Square Favorites of 2022 website 
-- but I don't think I'll be able to finish it and figure out all the flaws by the deadline so I 
am just turning in this studio with the hopes that it meets some of the requirements of the development
assignment... I am so deeply sorry to whichever TA has to grade this one... you're a real one for that.
